# PAM_clustering
This repository contains the r code in which PAM clustering was used as part of practice with unsupervised machine learning to classify a genetic sequence as belonging to either the TNF alpha gene or the PAM gene. The results of the model were assessed using both a silhouette plot as well as the Calinski-Harabasz index

The files contained in this repository are as follows:

PAM_clustering.R : This file contains the r code for a model that takes the genetic sequence for two genes from NCBI and classifies them using PAM clustering. The model will begin by using monomers and will expant to larger oligomers until the users specified silhouette value is reached. 

P53_fetch.fasta: Fasta file generated by the r code containing the nucleotide sequences for the P53 gene from NCBI

TNF_fetch.fasta: Fasta file generated by the r code containing the nucleotide sequences for the TNF gene from NCBI
